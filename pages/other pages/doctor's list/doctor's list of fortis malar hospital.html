                                            Dr. R. V. Thenmozhi is approachable. I am consulting her since past four months. She will always be available to her patients. Even if she is not available in the hospital, I can always seek her advice through phone or email. I am highly satisfied with her treatment. Fortis is also giving their best service. Waiting period will be less than 15 minutes. Staff are co operative and helpful.
